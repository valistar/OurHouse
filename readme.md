## OurHouse

This is a web application to track property expenses, maintenance, and wish lists. In the interest of playing with different toys, I'll be shoe-horning things in where they don't exactly fit (e.g. a nested set for property that will probably never be nested more than 3 levels deep and only soooort of belong in the same tree).

I'll be starting with MVC and a terrible UI and moving to API + some JS frontend eventually, probably.

Immediate todos include associating photos with property and handling property thats moved from one residence to another
